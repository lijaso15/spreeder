## Overview
Spreeding allows the reader to blaze through a reading with two key advantages. 
1. Having text centered will reduce the fatigue on your eyes from moving back and forth and refocusing
2. Spreeding will allow for us to absorb information at a rate matching our inner voice. Note that that is strictly faster than our speaking voice
